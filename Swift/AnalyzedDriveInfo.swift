/// This contains the fully analyzed results for a drive, this is returned from
/// `ZendriveDelegate.processAnalysis(ofDrive:)` callback for all the trips with the value of
/// `DriveInfo.driveType` not set to `DriveType.invalid`.
///
/// The data of this type will always be of equal or better quality than
/// `EstimatedDriveInfo` returned from `ZendriveDelegate.processEnd(ofDrive:)`
///
/// Typically `ZendriveDelegate.processAnalysis(ofDrive:)` will be fired within
/// a few seconds after `ZendriveDelegate.processEnd(ofDrive:)` callback but in some rare cases
/// this delay can be really large depending on phone network conditions.
///
/// The callback for this `ZendriveDelegate.processAnalysis(ofDrive:)` will be fired in trip
/// occurrence sequence, i.e. from oldest trip to the latest trip.
