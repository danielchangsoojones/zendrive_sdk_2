    ///
    /// Calling this method multiple times with the same values for
    /// applicationKey, driverId  and region is a no-op.

    /// driveDetectionMode are changed, but driverId, applicationKey and region remain same,
    /// calling this method would still be a no-op.
    /// If you want to change these configuration parameters, invoke teardown
    /// explicitly and call this method again with the new configuration.

    /// This method requires network connection for every time the setup is called with a
    /// different value for
    /// applicationKey, driverId pair to validate the applicationKey from the server.
