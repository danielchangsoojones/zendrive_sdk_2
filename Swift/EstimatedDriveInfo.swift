/// This contains the best estimated results for a drive, this is returned from

/// The data of this type will always be of same or little bad quality than

///
/// All drives with driveType not set to `DriveType.invalid` will get a
/// corresponding `ZendriveDelegate.processAnalysis(ofDrive analyzedDriveInfo:)` callback.
///
/// Typically `ZendriveDelegate.processAnalysis(ofDrive analyzedDriveInfo:)` will be fired within
/// a few seconds after `ZendriveDelegate.processEnd(ofDrive estimatedDriveInfo:)` callback but in some rare cases
/// this delay can be really large depending on phone network conditions.
